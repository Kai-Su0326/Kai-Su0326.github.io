##What have been done
I created the resume.html for my resume with a fake work experience. The stl.css file is the stylesheet for reseme.html and bio.html; ind.css is the stylesheet for index.html. The bio.html is a little negative thoughts that shouldn't exist at all. I'm sorry for that if it bothers anyone. The Mr._Bean_2011.jpg is a picture of Mr. Bean. I hope I can become positive like him someday. The index.html have all necessary elements but shabby.
