        <p>It is hard to transfer to CS from an irrelevant major. I doubted it before, but I deeply feel it now. The ideal schedule is to upgrade resume, do extracurricular projects, study CS foundation and apply summer internship within the first year. Unfortunately, I failed the internship part which is the most important part for getting a full-time job after graduation. The silver line is I have a full-stack project to do with my roommate in the summer. Still, as an international student who can easily be affected by an executive order, a person is just like a droplet in the ocean. </p>
